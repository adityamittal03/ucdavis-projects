**Abstract:** In 2023, the U.S. jewelry market was valued at an approximate 73.32 billion USD, with diamonds capturing a significant share. Consequently, accurate diamond price prediction of diamonds is critical for both jewelers and consumers alike. This paper explores several machine learning algorithms, including regression models, tree-based ensemble methods, and artificial neural networks, to predict diamond prices based on important characteristics such as carat, cut, color, and clarity. Our exploratory data analysis identified carat as the most influential feature with regards to diamond prices. Our methodology involves rigorous model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared ($R^2$) on testing data. The experimental results indicate that *XGBoost* outperformed other models by achieving the lowest testing error, followed closely by Random Forests and the Artificial Neural Network. Polynomial regression also performed well, capturing the non-linear relationship between diamond prices and its features. The neural network model also demonstrated strong results for predictions, and will benefit from further tuning. By developing a robust predictive model, we aim to enhance pricing precision, benefiting both businesses and consumers in the diamond market.
